# Work-in-progress

Tiny app whose purpose is manyfold :
* Put my hands in the setting up of a react app from scratch
* Build a small todoList with actions and reducer to play with redux, https://redux.js.org/
* Build another todoList with delayed actions to play with observables, https://redux-observable.js.org/
* Build a small user suggestions box inspired from https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754 to wrap my head around reactive programming

## Start app
Open your terminal at the root of the project and type
